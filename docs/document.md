# Solar eclipse

A **solar eclipse** is an astronomical event that occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun and blocks some or all of the Sun’s light for observers on Earth. Solar eclipses are notable because they can temporarily change daylight conditions, alter animal behavior, and provide rare opportunities to observe the Sun’s outer atmosphere (the corona) during a total eclipse. Solar eclipses differ from lunar eclipses in visibility: a solar eclipse is only visible from a limited region of Earth where the Moon’s shadow falls.

## Overview

Solar eclipses require three conditions:
1. The Moon must be in the **new moon** phase.
2. The Moon must be near a point where its orbit crosses the plane of Earth’s orbit around the Sun (near one of its orbital nodes).
3. The geometry must align so that the Moon’s shadow intersects Earth.

Because the Moon’s orbit is tilted relative to Earth’s orbital plane, most new moons do not produce a solar eclipse. Eclipses occur during “eclipse seasons,” which happen roughly twice per year when the Sun is close enough to the Moon’s orbital nodes for alignment to be possible.

## Types of solar eclipses

Solar eclipses are commonly categorized into four main types:

### Total eclipse
A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon completely covers the Sun’s visible disk as seen from a narrow path on Earth. Observers within this “path of totality” experience dramatic darkening and can see the corona, prominences, and the chromosphere. Totality typically lasts from a few seconds to several minutes at any given location, depending on the geometry of the Moon’s shadow and Earth’s rotation.

### Partial eclipse
A partial eclipse occurs when only part of the Sun is obscured by the Moon. This type is visible from a broader region surrounding the totality path (if a total eclipse occurs) or on its own when alignment is not sufficient for totality.

### Annular eclipse
An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun but appears too small to cover it completely. The result is a bright ring (an annulus) of sunlight around the Moon’s silhouette. This happens when the Moon is farther from Earth in its elliptical orbit, reducing its apparent diameter.

### Hybrid eclipse
A hybrid eclipse is rarer and can be total in some locations and annular in others along the eclipse path. This occurs due to Earth’s curvature and small variations in distance and alignment that change the apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon for different observers.

## Shadow geometry

The Moon casts two main shadow regions:
- **Umbra:** the central, darkest region where the Sun is fully blocked (total eclipse).
- **Penumbra:** the outer region where the Sun is only partially blocked (partial eclipse).

For annular eclipses, the central shadow is sometimes described as the **antumbra**, where the Moon is centered on the Sun but too small to cover it fully, creating the ring appearance.

## Eclipse phases and observation

Observers describe eclipse timing using “contacts”:
- **First contact:** the Moon first appears to touch the Sun’s edge.
- **Second contact:** totality begins (for total eclipses), often preceded by “Baily’s beads,” where sunlight shines through lunar valleys.
- **Maximum eclipse:** the moment of greatest coverage at a given location.
- **Third contact:** totality ends.
- **Fourth contact:** the Moon leaves the Sun’s disk, ending the event.

Safe observation is essential. Looking at the Sun without proper protection can cause serious eye injury. Certified eclipse glasses and appropriate solar filters are commonly recommended for partial phases. Totality (only during a total eclipse and only within the path of totality) is the brief period when it is safe to look at the eclipsed Sun with the naked eye.

## Frequency and recurrence

Solar eclipses happen somewhere on Earth relatively often, but they are uncommon from any single location. The narrow path of totality means many people never see a total eclipse without travel. Eclipses also follow long-term cycles; one well-known cycle is the Saros cycle, which relates eclipses separated by approximately 18 years to similar geometric conditions.

## Scientific and cultural significance

Historically, eclipses have influenced calendars, mythology, and early astronomical thinking. In modern science, solar eclipses have been used to study the Sun’s corona and to observe phenomena that are difficult to detect in normal daylight conditions. They also remain important public events that encourage interest in astronomy and science education.
